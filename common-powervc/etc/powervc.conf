# This file contains configuration properties that affects how the powervc driver functions and how it 
# communicates with the PowerVC server.   Most properties have default values based on a default
# PowerVC configuration. However, some connection properties, such as PowerVC host name
# do not have default values and must be configured prior to running the powervc driver.  These
# properties are marked with the text INPUT REQUIRED.  Also you may have to change other
# properties depending on your environment and how your PowerVC sever is configured.  For
# more information, see the Smart Cloud Entry Administration Guide.

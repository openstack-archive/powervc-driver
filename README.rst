How to Contribute
-----------------

The workflow of this project follows as much as the one of OpenStack_, so we
use Launchpad for bugs_ and blueprints_ management, and OpenStack Gerrit for
`code review`_ and further code integration.

*powervc-driver-core* is a group contains core reviewers who can vote +2 for
the integration approval, you can add it into your reviewer list, although all
of this task force will monitor the queue and provide comments.

How to Contribute
=================

**Welcome to contribute to IBM PowerVC Driver!**

The workflow of this project is similar to the one of OpenStack_, so we
use Launchpad for bugs_ and blueprints_ management, and OpenStack Gerrit for
`code review`_ and continous integration.

*powervc-driver-core* is a group contains core reviewers who can vote +2 for
the integration approval, you can add it into your reviewer list, although all
members of this task force will monitor the queue and provide help.

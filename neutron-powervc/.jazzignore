### Jazz Ignore 0
# Ignored files and folders will not be committed, but may be modified during 
# accept or update.  
# - Ignore properties should contain a space separated list of filename patterns.  
# - Each pattern is case sensitive and surrounded by braces ('{' and '}').  
# - "*" matches zero or more characters.  
# - "?" matches a single character.  
# - The pattern list may be split across lines by ending the line with a 
#     backslash and starting the next line with a tab.  
# - Patterns in core.ignore prevent matching resources in the same 
#     directory from being committed.  
# - Patterns in core.ignore.recursive matching resources in the current 
#     directory and all subdirectories from being committed.  
# - The default value of core.ignore.recursive is *.class 
# - The default value for core.ignore is bin 
# 
# To ignore shell scripts and hidden files in this subtree: 
#     e.g: core.ignore.recursive = {*.sh} {\.*} 
# 
# To ignore resources named 'bin' in the current directory (but allow 
#  them in any sub directorybelow): 
#     e.g: core.ignore.recursive = {*.sh} {\.*} 
# 
# NOTE: modifying ignore files will not change the ignore status of 
#     Eclipse derived resources.
